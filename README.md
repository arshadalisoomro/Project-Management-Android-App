Project Management Android Application

Current ideas:
 - Create account
    - Add events to your calender (unavailable periods of time).
 - Arrange meetings 
    - Clicking to arrange a meeting only shows times when all selected members are available (dependent on the selected meeting duration and the availability in each member's calender), sends out invite to all members.
 - 'Project manager' can create lists and assign tasks to group members (with deadlines).
    - Notifications to user when deadlines are nearing.
