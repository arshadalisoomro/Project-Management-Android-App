Project Management Android Application

Current ideas:
 - Create account
    - Add events to your calendar (unavailable periods of time).
 - Arrange meetings
    - Clicking to arrange a meeting only shows times when all selected members are available (dependent on the selected meeting duration and the availability in each member's calender), sends out invite to all members.
 - 'Project manager' can create lists and assign tasks to group members (with deadlines).
    - Notifications to user when deadlines are nearing.



To do:
  - Login/register functionality.
  - Decide whether on layouts, whether to use fragments for each separate functionality etc.
  - Design database.
  - How to store 'groups', add/delete people
  - How to uniquely identify each group member, username? unique number?
  - How to maintain security.
